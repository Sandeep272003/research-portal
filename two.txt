Acme Corporation Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

CEO: Good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter. 
Revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by robust demand in our cloud and AI segments.

CFO: Gross margins expanded to 58%, up 200 basis points, reflecting operational efficiencies and favorable product mix.

CEO: We saw particularly strong growth in enterprise customers. Our new AI platform launched in Q3 has been very well received — over 500 customers are already live.

Looking ahead, we are optimistic about 2024. We expect revenue growth of 10-12% and continued margin expansion. 
We plan to invest heavily in R&D and have announced two acquisitions that will accelerate our AI roadmap.

On capacity: our data centers are currently running at 85% utilization, up from 78% last year, and we are adding significant new capacity in Arizona and Ireland.

Challenges remain in the consumer segment due to macroeconomic uncertainty, but enterprise strength more than offsets this.

Operator: That concludes our prepared remarks.
